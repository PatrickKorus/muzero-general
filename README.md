# MuZero General Fork

This is the fork of the MuZero implementation at [werner-duvaud/muzero-general](https://github.com/werner-duvaud/muzero-general) which
closely follows the pseudo code attached to the [original paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08265v2). I have made some 
minor changes and made logging available in a `matplotlib` kind of fashion for our experiments described in  my thesis:

#### [An Evaluation of MCTS Methods for Continuous Control Tasks](https://github.com/PatrickKorus/muzero-general) 

The following docs are taken from [werner-duvaud/muzero-general](https://github.com/werner-duvaud/muzero-general) where
more documentation can be found. A detailed explanation of how MuZero works can also be found in my thesis.
